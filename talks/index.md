## <a name="Real+World%3A+Threat+Intelligence"></a>Real World: Threat Intelligence
by Elle Armageddon

When was the last time you considered the real-world threats users may be facing? The list includes stalkers, intimate partner violence, local-level law enforcement surveillance, spying bosses, and systemic oppression, all of which may pose different risks. In this session, we will discuss the disconnect between what the security community often thinks users need, what users think users need, and what users actually need. We'll also take a look at some basic steps we can take to improve the day-to-day lives of at risk users, and help make the world a safer place for marginalized people.

## <a name="Improving+Internet+Security+Through+Cooperation%3A+SIE+Europe+in+2018"></a>Improving Internet Security Through Cooperation: SIE Europe in 2018
by Paul Vixie

The digital ecosystem known as The Internet uniquely requires cooperation as a precondition for success or relevance, even among competitors. While creativity in interpretation of norms and boundaries can lead to short term successes, such creativity is made possibly only by those norms and boundaries. The Internet ultimately requires that competitors cooperate in some ways to succeed. One controversial form of cooperation is the sharing of security related telemetry in real time, for the good of all, and also for the good of whomsoever shares. Dr. Paul Vixie will explain how the Security Information Exchange (S.I.E.) project facilitates such cooperation, and will describe the new SIE Europe nonprofit company he helped start.

## <a name="Education+%26+communication"></a>Education & communication
by Ange Albertini

Information security is thankfully not limited to what experts know and can do, because they can't do much on their own, and non-experts will always be the weakest link.
An important part of Infosec problems is about dealing with 'standard', non-expert people.

So...let's just tell them that they're idiots, that they shouldn't use '123456' as password (and change it every week), install an antivirus, auto-update their system, stop clicking on links, uninstall Flash and Java!

Problems solved! We *told* them. What else do you expect?
Oh, they won't listen? Stupid ignorants.
We did our job, didn't we? It's *their* problem...

Maybe not?
This talk is about your relation with the non-technical people we have to deal with - whether we like it or not - in the world of Infosec.

## <a name="Modern+pentest+tricks+for+faster%2C+wider%2C+greater+engagements"></a>Modern pentest tricks for faster, wider, greater engagements
by Thomas Debize

The pentesting domain is constantly evolving and has quite changed in the last decade in order to provide more and more sophisticated, (bug-free) and complete tools. The ability to process wide data sets coming from multiple tools is becoming a true pentesting core skill.
This talk is nothing but the will of a 7-year experience pentester to share its coolest techniques, tools and procedures that he learned over time and that not everyone might be aware of.
If you never heard about Jython, sift, PyInstaller, CSVKit, Impacket, Frida, GNU Parallel, or you don’t have a clue of how they can be applied for your pentesting day-to-day job ; come on in, you will for sure (I hope) take at least something practical back with that talk.

## <a name="how+to+hack+a+Yacht+-+swimming+IoT"></a>how to hack a Yacht - swimming IoT
by Stephan Gerling

Modern vessels and yachts are equipped with a lot of specialized equipment communicating over internal control and IT networks,  and connected to Internet. 
Due to my background, I was curious to know how modern vessels navigate and how the ship electronic is working. This is why I asked for an access to a big expensive yacht to assess its security. 

The Backbone network of the vessels is nowadays based on NMEA0183 or the newer NMEA2000 , which is electrically similar to CAN Bus. 
The main IT network is connected to the backbone ship’s control network via the Ethernet-to-NMEA gateways. 
Cloud based apps give u access directly to the engine of the Yacht. 
Voila!  
We have a swimming IoT device with many attack vectors.
In my Talk i will show how to use vulnerabilities in internet Routers for maritime environment, lookup SatCom Boxes and their (In)security and how remote control, cloud services etc. connected to the Yacht IT equipment.

## <a name="Breaking+Parser+Logic%3A+Take+Your+Path+Normalization+off+and+Pop+0days+Out%21"></a>Breaking Parser Logic: Take Your Path Normalization off and Pop 0days Out!
by Orange Tsai

We propose a new exploit technique that brings a whole-new attack surface to defeat path normalization, which is complicated in implementation due to many implicit properties and edge cases. This complication, being under-estimated or ignored by developers for a long time, has made our proposed attack vector possible, lethal, and general. Therefore, many 0days have been discovered via this approach in popular web frameworks written in trending programming languages, including Python, Ruby, Java, and JavaScript.

Being a very fundamental problem that exists in path normalization logic, sophisticated web frameworks can also suffer. For example, we’ve found various 0days on Java Spring Framework, Ruby on Rails, Next.js, and Python aiohttp, just to name a few. This general technique can also adapt to multi-layered web architecture, such as using Nginx or Apache as a proxy for Tomcat. In that case, reverse proxy protections can be bypassed. To make things worse, we’re able to chain path normalization bugs to bypass authentication and achieve RCE in real world Bug Bounty Programs. Several scenarios will be demonstrated to illustrate how path normalization can be exploited to achieve sensitive information disclosure, SMB-Relay and RCE.

Understanding the basics of this technique, the audience won’t be surprised to know that more than 10 vulnerabilities have been found in sophisticated frameworks and multi-layered web architectures aforementioned via this technique.

## <a name="Worms+that+turn%3A+nematodes+and+neotodes"></a>Worms that turn: nematodes and neotodes
by Matt Wixey

Nematodes, or "anti-worms", exploit the vulnerabilities used by worms, but then attempt to disinfect and patch vulnerable hosts. In this talk, I discuss the history of nematodes; why previous implementations failed; and why it may be worth reconsidering, given the recent rise in unconventional worms using IoT, hardware, firmware, and other mediums. I will also show demos of a traditional nematode and a new IoT nematode I developed, and a nematode I wrote which identifies and reports on specific images found on infected hosts.

## <a name="Neuro-Hacking+%28The+science+behind+social+engineering+and+an+effective+security+culture%29"></a>Neuro-Hacking (The science behind social engineering and an effective security culture)
by Emmanuel Nicaise

Performing social engineering without understanding how the brain works is like using nmap without any knowledge of the TCPI/IP stack. It’s ok for script kiddies, not really for security professionals. After decades of dubious psychoanalytical theories, neuro-cognitive sciences bring us sounds and evidences-based theories explaining how (part of) the brain works and what are his flaws. How do we exploit these flaws, how can we fix them? How does the dark side use this knowledge and how can the light side use it to develop an effective security culture? Bring your brain with you and prepare it to download and install the new API’s spec to the 21st century human being.

## <a name="The+%28not+so+profitable%29+path+towards+automated+heap+exploitation"></a>The (not so profitable) path towards automated heap exploitation
by Thais aka barbieauglend

The modern world depends and rely on the security (and safety!) of software. To protect privacy, intellectual property, customer data and even national security are goals for most of us. Analysis tools can help us to get new insights that can be used to secure software and hardware by identifying vulnerabilities and issues, before they cause harm downstream. The automatic exploit generation is an old challenge in the industry that is not totally solved - in fact, we are far away from it, as Julien Vanegue stated in May this year. Furthermore, AEG is limited right now to stack-based buffer overflows and format string exploits as the semantic information about user bytes in memory is not available.
In this talk I am showing a proof of concept for automated heap exploit generation on an x86 architecture, using symbolic execution and SMT solvers.

## <a name="Make+ARM+Shellcode+Great+Again"></a>Make ARM Shellcode Great Again
by Saumil Udayan Shah

Compared to x86, ARM shellcode has made little progress. The x86 hardware is largely homogenous. ARM, however, has several versions and variants across devices today. There are several constraints and subtleties involved in writing production quality ARM shellcode which works on modern ARM hardware, not just on QEMU emulators.

In this talk, we shall explore issues such as overcoming cache coherency, reliable polymorphic shellcode, ARM egghunting and last but not the least, polyglot ARM shellcode. A bonus side effect of this talk will be creating headaches for those who like to defend agaisnt attacks using age old signature based techniques. There will be demonstrations of my shellcode on ARM IoT devices featuring different types of ARM architecture.

## <a name="Bypassing+Windows+Driver+Signature+Enforcement"></a>Bypassing Windows Driver Signature Enforcement
by Csaba Fitzl

Microsoft does a great effort to harden the Windows kernel and limit attackers to load their custom drivers (kernel rootkits) with the introduction of Driver Signature Enforcement in Win7x64. In this 4 hour workshop we will learn the limitation of this enforcement and practice how we can bypass it. We will explore 4 different methods (from very easy to difficult) on various versions of Windows, including Windows 10. We will see how and why they work, and which malware used them in the past.
First we will see how we can use leaked certificates to overcome DSE as well as how we can turn it OFF by design, and what are its limitations. Then we will use WinDBG to look into the kernel and find the various flags used to control DSE and use the HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver to do kernel exploitation for setting those to the value we require. We will use a simple dummy driver to demonstrate unsigned driver loading.

by Eva Szilagyi, David Szili

TL;DR: This two-hour workshop is about Bro's capabilities and cover topics such as Bro's architecture, Bro events, Bro logs, Bro signatures, Bro scripting, Bro + ELK.

Bro is an open-source Network Security Monitor (NSM) and analytics platform. Even though it has been around since the mid 90's, its main user base was primarily universities, research labs and supercomputing centers. In the past few years, however, more and more security professionals in the industry turned their attention to this powerful tool, as it runs on commodity hardware, thus providing a low-cost alternative to commercial solutions.

At its core, Bro inspects traffic and creates an extensive set of well-structured, tab-separated log files that record a network’s activity. Nonetheless, Bro is a lot more than just a traditional signature-based IDS. While it supports such standard functionality as well, Bro’s scripting language allows security analysts to perform arbitrary analysis tasks such as extracting files from sessions, detecting malware by interfacing with an external source, detecting brute-forcing, etc. It comes with a large set of pre-built standard libraries, just like Python.

During this two-hour workshop, we will learn about Bro's capabilities and cover the following topics:
- Introduction to Bro
- Bro architecture
- Bro events and logs
- Bro signatures
- Bro scripting
- Bro and Elastic Stack

by Paul Jung & Remi Chipaux

Most malwares are packed, that is a sad reality. Packing is a common method the hide a PE payload inside another PE payload in order to slow down reverse analysis and fool antiviruses. 
Some packing are simple but others, virtual machine based, full of anti-debugger, may be a real nightmare. One may only dump the final running payload, but for dynamic analysis, it is a real advantage to unpack cleanly the final payload. Reverser need to master this skill. We propose a workshop to learn how to unpack.
